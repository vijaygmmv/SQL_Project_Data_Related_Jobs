# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data-Centric job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.


### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
#### *Adding to that question, I am going to focus more on the Indian location and top & well-known data-centric roles (data analyst, data engineer, data scientist, and business analyst).*

1. What are the top-paying data-centric jobs in India?
2. What skills are required for the top-paying data-centric jobs in India?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for data-centric roles in India?
4. What are the top skills based on the salary in India?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn in India? 

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data-centric job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data-centric job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying data-centric Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered top data-centric positions (data analyst, data engineer, data scientist, and business analyst) by average yearly salary, focusing location on India. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT 
    j.job_title_short,
    c.name AS company_name,
    c.link_google,
    j.job_location,
    j.job_work_from_home,
    j.job_posted_date,
    j.job_schedule_type,
    j.salary_year_avg
FROM 
  job_postings_fact AS j
LEFT JOIN company_dim AS c ON j.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE j.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL  
  AND j.job_location = 'India' 
  AND (
      j.job_title_short LIKE '%Data%' 
      OR
      j.job_title_short LIKE '%Business%'
      )
ORDER BY 
  j.salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10; 

```

 *For this whole project, I am using the **LIKE** operator for filtration. which is working fine with my database.
But the proper way to write it was to use the **in** operator.*
```sql
where j.job_title_short in ('data analyst', 'data engineer', 'data scientist', 'business analyst') 
```

Here's the breakdown of the top data-centric Indian jobs in 2023:
 - **Wide Salary Range:**  Top 10 high paying data-centric roles span from $170,000 to $204,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse Employers:**  Companies like GSK, Bristol Myers Squibb, shell, and KONE are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Posting Dates:** The jobs were posted between October and December 2023, showing a healthy recruitment drive during the latter part of the year.
- These roles are **full-time** and based in India, with **no remote work** options listed.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs in India, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT 
        j.job_id,
        j.job_title_short,
        c.name AS company_name,
        j.salary_year_avg
    FROM 
      job_postings_fact AS j
    LEFT JOIN company_dim AS c ON j.company_id = c.company_id
    WHERE j.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
      AND j.job_location = 'India'
      AND (
          j.job_title_short LIKE '%Data%' OR
          j.job_title_short LIKE '%Business%'
          )
    ORDER BY 
      j.salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

-- Query to select skills for the top-paying jobs

SELECT  
    top.job_title_short,
    top.company_name,
    sd.skills,
    top.salary_year_avg
FROM 
  top_paying_jobs AS top
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS sj ON top.job_id = sj.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim AS sd ON sj.skill_id = sd.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    top.salary_year_avg DESC;
